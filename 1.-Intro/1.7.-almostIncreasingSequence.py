'''
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible
to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element
from the array.

Note: sequence a0, a1, ..., an is considered to be a strictly increasing if
a0 < a1 < ... < an. Sequence containing only one element is also considered
to be strictly increasing.
